## How to Play Taiko no Tatsujin?
 
Taiko no Tatsujin is a simple but addictive rhythm game that anyone can enjoy. The game consists of a horizontal scrolling screen that shows the notes that correspond to the song. The notes are either red or blue, indicating whether to hit the drum surface or the rim. The notes can also have different shapes and sizes, indicating how to hit the drum with different force and timing. The player has to hit the drum according to the notes and the music, while keeping the rhythm and accuracy. The game has four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard and Oni (or Extreme), which vary in speed and complexity.
 
The game can be played with different controllers depending on the platform. For arcade machines and home consoles, the game can be played with a special taiko drum controller that mimics the real instrument. The controller has a rubber surface and rim that can detect the hits and produce sound effects. The controller also has buttons for navigating menus and selecting songs. For mobile devices, the game can be played with touch screen controls that simulate the drum surface and rim. The player can tap or swipe the screen according to the notes. For PC simulators, the game can be played with keyboard or mouse controls that map to different parts of the drum.
